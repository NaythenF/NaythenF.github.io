				<p id="info"> Hi! I'm Naythen, a third year Computer Science student at Northwestern University.
					I am currently looking for internships/employment in the software engineering sector. A little about me outside
					of work and school, though -- I grew up in Oklahoma and graduated from Noble High School in 2018. In my free time,
					I play A LOT of video games of all different genres. I also enjoy keeping up with the current political landscape,
					as bleak as it may or may not be. As far as the professional side of things, I am looking to develop meaningingful
					software that helps improve the daily lives of users. A lot of times, these problems are like puzzles that I just
					cannot get enough of solving. I have a great work ethic and am always looking to learn something new/improve myself.
					I hope that maybe I could find a spot with you and your company!
