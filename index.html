                <img src="images/discord_example.png" alt="Embed displaying queue">
                <p> This summer, I started writing a bot for a chatting service
                    I use called Discord. I started by adding some simple
                    features, like playing a game of Hangman and little commands
                    such as one to randomly choose a choice from a list of given
                    items. These were just fun little projects for my own
                    enjoyment.
                </p>
                <p> Most recently, I implemented a queueing system for use in my
                    office hours for my teaching assistant job. This was the
                    the first time I had gotten to use my bot for a real
                    application, and I really enjoyed it. It works for any number
                    of TAs and students and shows the status of the queue in a
                    nicely formatted embed.
                </p>
                <p> This was all written using the discord.py module. I hope to
                    extend and add more functionality here in the future.

                <img id="shrink" src="images/reversi_example.png">
                <p> In my freshman year, we created several games using a game
                    engine created by our CS 211 professor. The most complicated
                    one we were tasked to create was a game called Reversi, where
                    to players are pitted against one another in a battle to
                    secure the most board spaces by flipping each others chips
                    to the opposite color.
                </p>
                <p> This game was programmed in C++ and allowed me to gain a lot
                    of familiarity with the data structures native to the language,
                    as well as the model, view, controller paradigm of game
                    of game programming. It also allowed me to create an aesthetic
                    interface for the players and work with a lower level graphics
                    engine.
